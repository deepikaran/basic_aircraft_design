# basic_aircraft_design
Python calculator for basic_aircraft_design based on MIT basic_aircraft_design notes https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-01-unified-engineering-i-ii-iii-iv-fall-2005-spring-2006/systems-labs-06/spl8.pdf

I have used B, c, L_h and approximate weight of the aircraft as inputs for the calculator based upon my RC aircraft design. You can change these to match your design.
